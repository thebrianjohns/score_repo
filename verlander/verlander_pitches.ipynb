    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "After nearly two full seasons due to injury, at the age of 39 Justin Verlander returned for the 2022 season to win the American League Cy Young award and World Series with the Houston Astros. Leading the league in a variety of statistics, Verlander dominated in his starts throughout the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch selection has played a key role into Verlander’s recent success with the Astros. Verlander throws four types of pitches (using MLB’s abbreviation): fastball (FF), slider (SL), curveball (CB), and changeup (CH).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, pitches are thrown in the context of an at-bat where the ball-strike count starts 0-0, and progresses until either the batter strikes out (reaches three strikes), is walked (reaches four balls), or is either hit-by-pitch or hits the ball in-play.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the count varies, pitchers often decide to favor certain pitches over others, e.g, with three balls (i.e., 3-X counts) the pitcher may favor throwing more accurate fastballs relative to out-of-the-zone offspeed pitches that are favored with two strikes (i.e., X-2 counts)."

In 2019, 9 `pitch_type`/`count` combinations had a greater than 10% difference between `actual%` and `expected%`, whereas only 5 do in 2022 (and the top 3 are significantly lower too).  This lends credence to the result of the chi-squared test that the `count` had a weaker relationship to `pitch_type` in the 2022 season than it did in the 2022 season."

    "The biggest difference between the seasons is that Verlander was willing to throw the Fastball less during the start of the at bat (0-0) and when he was behind in the count (3-1, 3-0).  He seemed to shift this distribution towards his Slider, which increased closer to the expected values in the chi-squared contingency table during dangerous counts (3-0 and 3-1).\n",

    "Two interesting notes on these results:\n",
    "1. His frequency of his Fastball on a 0-1 count increased, going against the grain in 2022 of pitching fewer fastballs at the beginning of the at-bat.  It seems in 2019 that Verlander liked to establish his fastball early and then follow it with the slider.  It seems in 2022, he was more willing to start with the Slider and follow it with a Fastball on a 0-1 count.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Verlander's Change-up had a big swing on a 3-2 count.  The sample size is small here (increasing the total number of change-ups thrown on that count from 0 to 6) but it highlights Verlander's willingness to go to his off-speed pitches more frequently in more dangerous situations in 2022.  This would seem to indicate that Verlander may have grown more confident to use the change-up as a secondary 'out' pitch (behind his slider) for the 2022 season."
